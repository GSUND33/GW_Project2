          <p class="lead", align="center">Thank you for taking our quiz and contributing to our analysis on 
            how people see and interpret data. Now, that was a tough quiz, and it has nothing to do with how 
            intelligent or fast you are at reading, scrolling, and zooming. The questions themselves were 
            inherently easy ones to answer, however the visualizations being presented were not always 
            the best choice to convey the answers. A good visualization should allow viewers to quickly 
            consume the information and understand the main points being presented. 
            <br>
            <br>
            See below for a breakdown of the quiz and how using the 
            right visualization can make all the difference. </p>
            <br>
          <p align="center">This quiz consisted of only 5 questions, the only thing changed was the order of 
            the answers and the visualizations which accompanied them. </p>

        <ul class="my-list-style">
          <li>Which Industry has the third highest average employment? </li>
          <li>Which State has the lowest average annual pay</li>
          <li>In which year did Education and Health Services first pass 35K in Average Annual Pay?</li>
          <li>Are more industries paying annual wages above or below the average?</li>
          <li>In which State is the county with the most highest paying jobs?</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
            

            <!-- Question 1 -->

            <Section>

            <h3 class="imageNav-header", align="center">Dimension vs Measure</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p class="lead", align="center">In the first question you were asked to identify
              which industry, a dimension<sup>1</sup> had the third highest average 
              employment, a measure<sup>2</sup>. Looking at the below bar 
              chart it is easy to quickly identify Education and Health Services as the correct answer. </p>
            <br>
              <img src="https://github.com/aisaacson1/GW_Project2/blob/master/Test_pics/Category_vs_Value_Bar.PNG?raw=true" height="auto" width=75% alt="" align="center">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="lead", align="center">The two below images dipicted the same information 
              in a different way, relying on your ability to quickly judge the size of each shape 
              to determine which value was the third largest. Judging minor differences in the size
              of objects is typically much harder for people to do accuratley and quickly, making 
              these visualizations a  poor choice to convey the desired message.</p>

            <br>
              <p class="lead", align="center">Many people like to use pie charts to show the type of data used in this question. 
                Although as it is easy to see from the below image, pie charts are not the best choice to show how an even realatively
                low number of items stack up against each other. As in the charts above, it is difficult to judge which wedges
                of the pie are larger than others without further information, which in a chart showing this many variables 
                would quickly get crowded and difficult to read. </p>

            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <Section>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3 class="imageNav-header", align="center">Dimension vs Measure with Location</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p class="lead", align="center">The next question asked which state had the lowest average annual pay. 
                Individuals answering questions such as this often like to use maps in order to depict the data 
                geographically. However maps are best suited for conveying information with large differences between
                the various data points, or to show specific locations that are far enough apart to avoid overlapping. 
                In this case as seen in these maps from the quiz, the data doesnt have enough disparity to allow readers
                to easily identify specific information such as the state with the lowest pay.                
            </p>
            <br>
              <img src="https://github.com/aisaacson1/GW_Project2/blob/master/Test_pics/Value_vs_Location_Map_filled.PNG?raw=true" height="auto" width=75% alt="" align="center">

            <br>
            <br>
              <p class="lead", align="center">In this case the below bar chart was much better suited to quickly allow
                Pennsylvania to be identified as the answer simply by looking for the last bar in the chart.</p>
            <br>

              <img src="https://github.com/aisaacson1/GW_Project2/blob/master/Test_pics/Value_vs_Location_Bar.PNG?raw=true" height="auto" width=75% alt="" align="center">

            <h3 class="imageNav-header", align="center">Dimension vs Measure with Time</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p class="lead", align="center">Depicting information relating to time is often best viewed on a line graph. 
              The question asking the year in which Education and Health Services first passed 35K in Average Annual Pay,
              definetly puts this to the test. While the below line graph allows viewers to easily identify that 
              Education and Health Services passed the 35K mark in 2012, this fact was not immediatley obvious and required 
              the use of a legend to decipher which line to follow. 
            </p>
            <br>
              <img src="https://github.com/aisaacson1/GW_Project2/blob/master/Test_pics/Value_vs_Time_Line.PNG?raw=true" height="auto" width=75% alt="" align="center">
            <br><br>
            <br>
            <p class="lead", align="center">The same information can also be easily and quickly identifed in the below chart
              requiring you to simply find the correct industry and travers over to the correct year.

            <br>
              <p class="lead", align="center">As easy as it was to use a chart, the below visual which only swaps the industry
                and time values used in the line graph then plots the data as rings is almost useless to a reader attempting to 
                see how much an industry paid each year.

            <hr>
            <br>
            <p class="lead", align="center">The fourth question asked you to compare information in order to determine if most
              industires were paying annual wages above or below the average. This question was asked three times using a bar chart, 
              a text chart, and a pie chart. All three of these visuals adequately conveyed the information needed to answer this question.
              However the following two charts required you to count each industry to figure out the answer, consuming precious seconds 
              on a timed question.

              <p class="lead", align="center">The final question asked you to identify in which state was the 
                county with the most highest paying jobs. As with the rest of the questions in this quiz, both 
                visuals provide enough information to come to the correct conclusion. In the below scatter plot
                you were required to read both axis in order to identify which direction corresponded to pay and
                which corresponded to the number of jobs. You then had to use the legend to identify which state
                the dot at the furthest right belonged to, identifying New York as the state with the most highest
                paying jobs.

                which lack a label allows for a much quicker conclusion. When using this chart the reader can use the color
                legend and immediatley identify New York County in the state of New York as the largest dark blue bubble 
                and therefore the state with the most highest paying jobs.
