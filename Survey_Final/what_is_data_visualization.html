      <p class="lead">In short, data visualization is the <b>representation of data in a graphical or pictorial format.</b>

It allows key decision-makers to see complex analytics in a visual layout, so they can identify new patterns or grasp challenging concepts. 

From website metrics and sales team performance to marketing campaign results and product adoption rates, there is a range of data points your organization needs to track. 

When you have your hands full juggling multiple projects at once, you need a quick and effective reporting method that allows you to get a clear point across. Do you know which types of data visualization method to use?</p>

      <h2 align="center">Five Essential Reasons to Implement Data Visualization Tools</h2>
      <p class="lead">If you’re on the fence about which type of visual will work best for your company, it helps to understand the top business functions that data visualization can serve. Here are the main five to consider.</p>
      <br></br>

      <h4 align="left">1. Comparing Values</h4>
      <p>As data analysts, you see your fair share of data sets. When you want to compare the differences and similarities between these sets, charts are ideal. They easily reveal the high and low values of a particular set so you can note major differences, gaps, and other trends. 
      </p>
        <p>If you need to create a comparison chart, the following types of visualizations are appropriate:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
          <li>Column Chart</li>
          <li>Bar Graph</li>
          <li>Line Graph</li>
          <li>Mekko Chart</li>
          <li>Pie Chart</li>
          <li>Scatter Plot Chart</li>
          <li>Bullet Graph</li>          
        </ul>

      <h4 align="left">2. Show Composition</h4>
      <p>You might also need to break your value sets apart, showing how individual units affect the greater picture. For instance, you may want to track overall mobile access on your website by device type or geographical location. Or, you might want to know which elements of your recent digital marketing campaign proved the most successful.
      </p>
        <p>In this case, you can use any one of these types of data visualizations:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
          <li>Stacked Bar Graph</li>
          <li>Area Chart</li>
          <li>Mekko Chart</li>
          <li>Pie Chart</li>
          <li>Waterfall Chart</li>
        </ul>

      <h4 align="left">3. Determine Distribution</h4>
      <p>Are you trying to understand the overarching distribution of your data? If so, a distribution chart will show all of the possible intervals or values of the value set as well as how often they occur. 
      </p>
        <p>From this visualization, you can identify the normal trends as well as any outliers that could disrupt them. You can also get a clear picture of how wide the range is between your information values.
        </p>
        <p>You can reach for the following types of data visualizations when you need to determine distribution:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
          <li>Column Chart</li>
          <li>Bar Graph</li>
          <li>Line Graph</li>
          <li>Mekko Chart</li>
          <li>Scatter Plot Chart</li>
        </ul>
      <h4 align="left">4. Researching Trends</h4>
      <p>Did you wrap up a recent television advertising campaign? What about a new product launch? 
      </p>
      <p>Once the dust settles and it’s time to get back to work, it’s your job to see if those efforts succeeded. When you want to determine how a particular data set performed during a set time frame, these types of visualizations work well:
      </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
          <li>Column Chart</li>
          <li>Dual Axis Chart</li>
          <li>Line Graph</li>
        </ul>

      <h4 align="left">5. Understanding Relationships in Different Types of Data Visualization</h4>
      <p>Sometimes, the best way to understand a given variable is to see how it relates to one or multiple other variables. For instance, one variable could have a positive or negative effect on another. 
      </p>
      <p>You can use these types of charts to visually depict the relationship between things:
      </p>
     <ul style="list-style-type:square;"
     <li>Scatter Plot Chart</li>
     <li>Bubble Chart</li>
     <li>Line Graph</li>


    <p>This is one of the most common types of data visualization tools. There’s a reason we learn how to make column charts in elementary school. They’re a simple, time-honored way to show a comparison among different sets of data. You can also use a column chart to track data sets over time.</p>

<p>A column chart will include data labels along the horizontal (X) axis with measured metrics or values presented on the vertical (Y) axis, also known as the left side of the chart. The Y-axis will normally start at 0 and go as high as the largest measurement you’re tracking.</p>

<p>You can use column charts to track monthly sales figures, revenue per landing page, or similar measurements. Consistent colors help keep the focus on the data itself, though you can introduce accent colors to emphasize important data points or to track changes over time.</p>
