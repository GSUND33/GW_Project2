          <p class="lead", align="center">Thank you for taking our quiz and contributing to our analysis on 
            how people see and interpret data. Now, that was a tough quiz, and it has nothing to do with how 
            intelligent or fast you are at reading, scrolling, and zooming. The questions themselves were 
            inherently easy ones to answer, however the visualizations that were presented were not always 
            the best choice to convey the answers. See below for a breakdown of the quiz and how using the 
            right visualization can make all the difference. </p>
          <p class="lead", align="center">Our quiz consisted of only 5 questions, the only thing changed was the order of 
            the answers and the visualizations which accompanied them. </p>

            <li>Which State has the lowest average annual pay</li>
            <li>In which year did Education and Health Services first pass 35K in Average Annual Pay?</li>
            <li>Are more industries paying annual wages above or below the average?</li>
            <li>Which State has the county with the highest paying jobs?</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Question 1 -->

          <Section>

          <h3 class="imageNav-header", align="center">Dimension vs Measure</h3>
          <hr>
          <br>
          <p class="lead", align="center">In the first question you were asked to identify
             which industry, a dimension<sup>1</sup> had the third highest average 
             employment, a measure<sup>2</sup>. Looking at the below bar 
             chart it is easy to quickly identify Education and Health Services as the correct answer. </p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="lead", align="center">The two below images dipicted the same information 
            in a different way, relying on your ability to quickly judge the size of each shape 
            to determine which value was the third largest. Judging minor differences in the size
             of objects is typically much harder for people to do accuratley and quickly, making 
             these visualizations a  poor choice to convey the desired message.</p>

          <!-- Question 2 -->
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3 class="imageNav-header", align="center">Dimension vs Measure with Location</h3>
          <hr>
          <br>
          <p class="lead", align="center">The next question asked which state had the lowest average annual pay. 
              Individuals answering questions such as this often like to use maps in order to depict the data 
              geographically. However maps are best suited for conveying information with large differences between
               the various data points, or to show specific locations that are far enough apart to avoid overlapping. 
               In this case as seen in these maps from the quiz, the data doesnt have enough disparity to allow readers
               to easily identify specific information such as the state with the lowest pay.                
          </p>

          <br>
          <br>
            <p class="lead", align="center">In this case the below bar chart was much better suited to quickly allow
               Pennsylvania to be identified as the answer simply by looking for the last bar in the chart.</p>
